# RedOT â€“ Red Team Toolkit for Robots and OT Systems

## Overview

RedOT is a modular, fully operational toolkit designed for red teaming autonomous robots, OT/ICS systems, and smart environments. It includes advanced capabilities for wireless exploitation, firmware manipulation, hardware interface attacks, AI deception, covert payloads, and real-time control via a multi-agent dashboard.

## Core Features

- Wireless attacks: BLE spoofing, RF replay, Evil Twin with implant injection
- Firmware unpacking, payload poisoning, and CVE-based exploitation
- UART and JTAG hardware interfaces with auto extraction and binary dumping
- AI manipulation: adversarial images, TTS command injection, spoofed sensors
- Covert communication: DNS C2 with AES, Tor proxy, and persistence logic
- Real-time dashboard with agent control, alert feed, and integrated Copilot
- GPT-assisted module chaining, report generation, and post-execution automation

## Modules
