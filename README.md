# RedOT â€“ Red Team Toolkit for Robots and OT Systems

## Overview

RedOT is a modular offensive framework for red teaming autonomous gardener robots and operational technology (OT) systems. It includes capabilities for:

- Wireless exploitation: BLE, RF, Evil Twin attacks
- Firmware analysis and automated CVE-based exploitation
- Hardware interface attacks: UART, JTAG memory dumping
- AI adversarial manipulation and sensor spoofing
- Covert payloads, implants, and command-and-control over DNS
- Real-time dashboard, multi-agent control, and GPT-based Copilot modules
